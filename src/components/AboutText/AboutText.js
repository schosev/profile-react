  <p>
    I am a full stack web developer. I started as a COBOL mainframe developer with DST and was given the opportunity to join
    the front-end web development team. I was responsible for providing front-end support for the leading mutual 
    fund companies websites. I was self taught but realized I needed to quickly expand my
    skill set to work as a web developer full time. I joined the KU Coding Bootcamp to learn full stack development
    and enjoyed the challenge. I learned a lot of new skills and would love the opportunity to apply those skills
    to a new job. I look forward to continuing to learn and expand my skills throughout my career.
